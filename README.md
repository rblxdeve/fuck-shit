# FUCKSHIT
An esoteric programming language made with 21 lines of python!
# ---------------------------------------------------
Esoteric programming languages, or esolangs for short, are programming languages designed to be difficult to understand or use. They are often created as a form of art or for fun, rather than for practical purposes.

Inspired by the idea of esolangs, I decided to create my own, where the only syntax are "1" and "2" and any other characters will be ignored as comments.
The syntax "1" will be used more often than syntax "2", which is used to prompt the user to enter an ascii decimal character. By writing "1" followed with a space and another "1", you just wrote "STX" character in ascii decimal.
# ---------------------------------------------------
Example:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 <- represents TAB in ascii decimal because there at nine "1" characters and 9 is the ascii decimal for TAB
```

This is a really simple idea to understand if you are an intermediate programmer.

Here is more information of the ASCII Table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII

Hopefully you get the hang of this esolang, make sure to check out my other projects that I upload on my github.
